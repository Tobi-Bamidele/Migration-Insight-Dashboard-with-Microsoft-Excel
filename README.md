# Migration Insight Dashboard with Microsoft Excel

## About the project
In this project, we will be analyzing migration data of people from different countries moving to foreign countries. We will dive deep to find out the major reasons people tend to migrate from their countries to foreign countries.

We have over 40,000 records. From the provided data, we are going to carry out the following.

1. Analysis of the visa types issued which could either be for work purposes, education, visitation, for residence purposes
2. Analysis of the age group of travellers
3. Analysis of those travellers travelling with pets and those travelling without pets
4. Gender-based analysis
5. The data is a two-month data (January-February), we are to find out the total number of records for each month
6. Analysis of the status of the visa issued
7. We are also required to compare the number of records from the following selected countries: Nigeria, Niger, Niue, and Nicaragua

### Tools
